## Overview

VaxMen is a cooperative game for 2 players in which you become a member of a more and more popular anti-vax movement. Your goal is to make the world a better (less populated) place, by saving the children from getting vaccinated. You are set in the children's clinic, where you will try your best to:

* swap existing vaccines for fake ones
* forge clinic records of vaccination
* and even carry the children out of the clinic to save them

### But it won't be easy!

Watch out, because on your way there will be duty doctors suspicious of every stranger in the clinic. The building is guarded with monitoring and a receptionist. The doors are locked. And the time is running out! 

### Cooperate!

You will not be able to complete your mission on your own. The guards are very careful and you will not slip through the security unseen. Here is where the second player comes in! His role will be to distract the guards or help you with other cooperative activities, like passing a child through the window.

### Be quick!

Time is running out and you still have a lot to do. Distribute your tasks wisely and cooperate to make the most of your time.

## What next?

VaxMen has a great potential for an awesome family game, with idea of expanding the game with dozens of new levels, different activities, different type of security measures, bigger and more complex maps, more cooperative actions.

The game would also need a fresh look, which wasn't made in 3 hours at 4am - 7am, potentially 3D low-poly style. UI would also need improvements.

Having said that the game needs a lot of work which is not likely to pay off, at the time where both of us have other projects. This means we are not developing the game right now.
